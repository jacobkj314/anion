The problem was further complicated by the sequence of unstable Anglo-Norman successions over the previous sixty years\u2014William the Conqueror had gained England by force, William Rufus and Robert Curthose had fought a war between them to establish their inheritance, and Henry had only acquired control of Normandy by force.

Flocculation can be used to describe reversible aggregation involving weaker attractive forces, and the aggregate is usually called a \"floc\". The term precipitation is normally reserved for describing a phase change from a colloid dispersion to a solid (precipitate) when it is subjected to a perturbation. Aggregation causes sedimentation or creaming, therefore the colloid is unstable: if either of these processes occur the colloid will no longer be a suspension.", "Could the particles in a coagulation be split back apart if one were to mix hard enough?\nIf the interaction energy is greater than kT, the attractive forces will prevail, and the colloidal particles will begin to clump together. This process is referred to generally as aggregation, but is also referred to as flocculation, coagulation or precipitation. While these terms are often used interchangeably, for some definitions they have slightly different meanings. For example, coagulation can be used to describe reversible , impermanent aggregation where the forces holding the particles together are weaker than any external forces caused by stirring or mixing. Flocculation can also be used to describe reversible aggregation involving weaker attractive forces, and the aggregate is usually called a \"floc\". The term precipitation is normally reserved for describing a phase change from a colloid dispersion to a solid (precipitate) when it is subjected to a perturbation.
